selling weapons back for reduced price
more fair spawn areas
randomize terrain between each round
keep track of score
make match end condition
    - objective in middle that is surrounded byu highly epxlosive resistant material?
solve grenade spam
    - make more expensive 
    - hold down button to charge throw
        - oscillating?
maybe, a match ends when the supertreasure in the center is collected (it is surrounded by tough material)
    - maybe each round is a "floor" or "level" where in the middle (or somewhere else) is a hatch or ladder that is surrounded by tough stuff
    - the last person left behind is the one who loses (maybe just loses a point or doesn't get a bonus, idk)
    - can configure how many floors long a match is
    - if there is last man standing, the round restarts on the same floor. only continue to next floor if at least 1 person made it to the hatch. that way, there could be progression of explosive power needed to break through the material around the hatch.
    - maybe the playfield size gets bigger as the floors go on
